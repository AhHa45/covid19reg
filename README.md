# COVID-19 attendance registration

This is a simple COVID-19 attendance registration tool that can be used at any venue, like sports clubs, churches, restaurants, bars, etc.

## Why should I use this tool?

This tool registers attendees at your venue and is the digital equivalent of paper registration ballots that you can hand-out and collect in a closed box. If somebody happens to get COVID-19 and this person was at your venue, this tool will help you contact the people that might have been exposed.

## How about privacy?

In short: the tool stores the answers (email address or phone number) in a file on the server. This file is automatically overwritten after a month. It is designed in a way that only the system administrator has access to this data.

## Dependencies

The tool requires PHP 7. The QR-code is generated by: https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator.
