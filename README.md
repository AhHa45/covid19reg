# COVID-19 attendance registration

This is a simple COVID-19 attendance registration tool that can be used at any venue, like sports clubs, churches, restaurants, bars, etc.

## Why should I use this tool?

If somebody happens to get COVID19 and this person was at your venue, you can use this tool to warn other attendees.

## How about privacy?

In short: the tool stores the answers (email address or phone number) in a file on the server. This file is automatically overwritten after a month. 

## Dependencies

The tool requires PHP. The QR-code is generated by: https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator
